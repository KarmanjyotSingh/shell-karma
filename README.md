# karma-shell - Linux Shell in C
___ 

## Execution Instructions

- run `make` to create an executable `shell`
- run command `./shell` in the terminal , and there the shell runs.

## Introduction

**This is a Linux C-Shell implemented by me.**  
- To exit the shell : 
   1. Press <kbd>Ctrl + D</kbd> , saves the current session history , and exits the terminal 
   2. enter `exit` command in terminal.
   3. **Assumptions** : 
      1. note that : `max_length` of command names are assumed to be of max-length `name_len` defined in `header.h` as `1024`
   
      2. `history` command displays the `10` last commands entered , with latest command on the top. 
   
## Shell Features

1. The shell supports the following commands being implemented by me : `bg` , `cd` , `echo` , `fg` , `history` , `jobs` , `ls` , `pinfo` , `pwd` , `replay` , `repeat` , `sig` , and other external `shell commands` .

2. It with support for `redirection` operations [ `>` , `<` , `>>` ] and `piping` [ `|` ] .
   
3. Error Handling
   
4. Signal Handling for signals like `SIGINT` , `SIGTSTP` , `SIGCHLD` and external keyboard interrupts like <kbd>Ctrl +C</kbd> , <kbd>Ctrl + Z</kbd>.
    
5. Running processes in `foreground` & `background` environments along with 
   
6. Command `history` implemented, storing the latest commands , that remains saved across shell-sessions.
   
7. Multiple commands separated by `;` handled, However there's no support for handling `"` or `'` ( quotes ).
   

The command implemented are as follows :

- `bg` : used to continue the execution of stopped background processes in the background environment.

- `cd` : To change the current working directory of the shell , it also supports multiple flags like : `-` , `.` , `~` , `..` etc. along with error messages.
  
- `echo` : To output the input string onto the terminal ,supports `redirection` and `piping`

- `fg` : To continue the execution of a stopped background process [ stored in the `jobs` list ] in the foreground.

- `history` : Implemented linked list kind structure to store the `20` latest commands entered in the shell . History remains saved across the sessions.
  
  `history` : displays latest entered 10 commands.

  `history <number>` :  displays the latest `number` history commands.

- `jobs` : A linked list data structure , implemented to keep a track of processes invoked in the background of the shell ( either by the user directly ( using the `&` flag)) or when a process running in foreground is stopped due to recieving of  `signal or interrupt` ( like `Ctrl + Z` or any other signal). 
  
  stores the process sorted lexographically in a linked list structure.

  `jobs` prints the [`job_number`] `process_status` `process_name` `pid` for processes stored in  the data structure. 

  `[-options]` : `-r` and `-s` flags for specifically printing processes with status `Running` or `Stopped` respectively.

- `ls` : executes the listing command like normal shell , along with proper handling of flags `[-al]` in any order and any number of times. 

   supports multiple files and directories , and `flags` in any order.

   Implemented colors for different kind of files - `directory`,`files`,`executable` etc. to make them visually distinguishable.

- `pinfo` : outputs the status information of the processes.

  `pinfo` : displays the process information for the shell .

  `pinfo <proc_pid>` : displays the process information for the process with given pid and displays appropriate error messages, in case of failures or wrong input format.

- `pwd` : outputs the present working directory , handles errors.
  
- `replay` : 
  
  `Usage :`

  `replay -command <command> -interval <interval> -period <period>` , that makes the command provided by the command flag , to replay itself ( or execute ) at fixed intervals provided by interval flag `<interval>` for a given `<period>`.

  - Handles errors in case of wrong syntax or missing arguments.
  - Flags can be used in any order 
  - Multiple flags of same kind , not allowed ; considered as wrong syntax and an error message is displayed.
  
- `repeat` :
   
   `Usage:`

   `repeat <number_of_repetitions> <command>` : repeats the command given , `<number_of_repetitions>` times. 

   - Handles errors , in case of wrong syntax or incorrect arguments provided.
  
-  `sig` : used to communicate with processes running in background of the shell ( stored in `jobs` data structure) by sending them signals to processes indicated by their job numbers . 
   
   `sig <job_num> <sig_num>` : sends the signal indicated by `<sig_num>` to the process indicated by `<job_num>`, handles errors in case of wrong syntax or failure in sending the signals.
  
-   other `shell commands` : runs the other shell commands by creating a child process using forking , and executes the commands provided using `execvp` sys call , displays apt error message in case of any failure.
